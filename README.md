## 🚀 Overview

GuardianChain is a unified platform that combines Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain to improve how individuals manage health insights, mental well-being, and personal safety.

It transforms fragmented, reactive wellness systems into a proactive, intelligent, and verifiable experience, empowering users with clarity, transparency, and ownership over their data.

Built as a hackathon project, GuardianChain demonstrates how emerging technologies can be applied meaningfully to solve real-world challenges in healthcare, safety, and digital trust.

## 🏆 Why GuardianChain?

❌ Fragmented health & wellness tools

## 🧠 How It Works
<p align="center"> <img src="assets/architecture-diagram.png" alt="GuardianChain Architecture" width="700"/> </p>

- User interacts with the GuardianChain Dashboard

- AI processes medical or wellness inputs

- Insights are generated in real time

- Key records are verified using blockchain principles

- Users earn rewards and track progress securely

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### 🎨 Frontend (User Experience Layer)

React – Component-based UI for a responsive and scalable dashboard

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling for a clean, modern, and consistent interface

### ⚙️ Backend (Application & API Layer)

Node.js – Server-side runtime for handling application logic and integrations

Express.js – Lightweight REST API framework for routing, authentication, and data flow

### 🤖 AI Layer (Intelligence & Insight Layer)

AI Models – Analyze medical inputs and generate simplified, human-readable summaries

Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Extract wellness insights and support mental health tracking

Inference-Based Architecture – Focused on real-time interpretation rather than raw data storage

### 🔐 Blockchain Layer (Trust & Verification Layer)

Solidity Smart Contracts – Define secure, verifiable logic for record validation

Polygon / Ethereum Testnet – Cost-efficient and scalable blockchain infrastructure

Hash-Based Verification – Ensures data integrity while preserving privacy by keeping sensitive data off-chain

### 🎯 Architectural Rationale

AI provides intelligence, interpretation, and decision support

Blockchain ensures trust, immutability, and transparency

Off-chain storage + on-chain verification balances scalability, privacy, and cost

This modular stack enables GuardianChain to remain scalable, secure, and purpose-driven, aligning with real-world deployment constraints and hackathon evaluation criteria.

### 🎯 AI & Blockchain — Clear Separation of Roles
Technology	Purpose
AI	Intelligence, interpretation, pattern detection
Blockchain	Trust, integrity, transparency, verification

This ensures practical integration, not superficial usage.
